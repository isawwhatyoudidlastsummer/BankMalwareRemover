## About Bank Malware Remover
On 3rd January 2018, Quick Heal posted a [blog](http://blogs.quickheal.com/android-banking-trojan-targets-232-apps-including-indian-banks) about Android.banker.A2f8a Malware that targets more than 232 banking apps including those offered by Indian banks.
And during a [YouTube Video Interview](https://youtu.be/FVYSWDbeKik) I decided to create this simple app detector that checks for an app with package name yqyJqWdtdf.UOaOrquyRDgLFgGueha in users installed apps.
If this package name app is found it requests users to uninstall this app from its device.
